Redstone Repository Revolved is an addon to Redstone Aresnal which adds tools and weaponry which utilize Redstone Flux. Original mod written by TehNut and Tombenpotter for MC1.6/1.7. This is a rewrite for 1.12+ by thundR, and continued by the community.

## Dev setup

### Workspace Setup
1. Fork and run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` then (if you use Eclipse) `gradlew eclipse` or (if you use IDEA) `gradlew genIntellijRuns`. This process should automatically setup the libs listed below.
2. Open in IDE of your choice.

### Dependencies
All of these are required for the dev workspace to work correctly:

#### Deobsfucated (Automatically pulled in with maven)
* CoFHCore 
* Redstone Arsenal 

#### Needed to load
* Thermal Foundation 
* Thermal Expansion
* Baubles

## Credits
 - TehNut for the original 1.7.10 mod.
 - KingLemming and the rest of CoFH for code, libraries, frameworks, and general inspiration. After all, this mod is just changing RedstoneArsenal numbers :)
 - Members of MMD and other discords for answering dumb questions.
